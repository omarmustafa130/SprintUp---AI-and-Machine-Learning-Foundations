    "-   **Read Mode (`'r'`)**: Default mode. Used to read the contents of a file. If the file does not exist, it will raise a `FileNotFoundError`.\n",
    "-   **Write Mode (`'w'`)**: Used to write (or overwrite) content to a file. If the file does not exist, it will be created. **If the file already exists, its existing content will be completely erased (overwritten) before new content is written.**\n",
    "-   **Append Mode (`'a'`)**: Used to add new content to the end of an existing file. If the file does not exist, it will be created. This mode does not overwrite existing content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other common modes include:\n",
    "-   `'x'`: Exclusive creation mode. Creates a new file, but raises an error if the file already exists.\n",
    "-   `'b'`: Binary mode. Used for non-text files (e.g., images, audio). Combine with `r`, `w`, or `a` (e.g., `'rb'`, `'wb'`).\n",
    "-   `'+'`: Update mode. Opens a file for both reading and writing. Combine with `r`, `w`, or `a` (e.g., `'r+'`, `'w+'`, `'a+'`)."
